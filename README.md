# AnimalAdoption
Animal Adoption program
# Description
This program allows dog/cat shelters to be able to control
the inventory of animals. In addition, allowing the manager
or owner to add onto the inventory. In terms of someone
who wishes to adopt, they can do so and the manager will
be able to vet the adoptee by asking specific questions 
and getting info from the adoptee (SSN, Address, fence, etc.)
Also when adopted, the system will automatically remove the
animal function in which the adopted animal's info is stored
under.
